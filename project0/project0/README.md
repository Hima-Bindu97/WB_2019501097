# Project 0
	My project0 contains 9 html pages and 5 css files.
1)Starting with index.html file-->It is a simple html file with a titleand a link tag which defines a link between external reources and href indicating a url cascading.css where css file has properties like color and text-align to a paragraph.Index.html body contains <a> tag that defines destination link through href and a image using <img>tag.It will navigate to sample.html file
2)sample.html:It is a simple html page that contains a title,body and a hyperlink to move to another pages.It will navigate to contact.html file
3)contact.html:This file describes about myself.It contains <div> tag which is used for division of html document.It has an image and in style tag i have used @media query like @media(min-width) and @media(max-width) which helps in increasing and decreasing the screen according to the given pixels.Body tag contains a hyperlink to myjourney.html and this file is included with ol and ul tags where ol says about name and education.ul describes phonenumber and address.
4)myjourney.html:It has a link tag to style2.css where h1,tr,td is set to one color and alignment is to center.I have used @media query to adjust screen.In the body i have included my courses and course duration and has a form that has a radio button to select a country.This page will navigate user to first.html
5)first.html:It has a link to style.css where it has some color and alignment change.In body it has a para id which leads to para.css file which has a border and adjust color and text alignment.Body contains an image and a form.It will navigate the page to nested.html
6)nested.html:A list inside a list is called nested list.It has nested.scss file.Here i have used scss variable called $color because if we want to change the color more times in html files we go to css files.In css files also if we want to use the same color for h1,h2...h6,tr,td,ul,ol etc.., we have to change in ever element.But like c if we fix a variable and declare its value it will not be changed in the entire program.Like that if $color is assigned to some color it will be same throughout.In my example i have used $color to ul,ol.This page will navigate to example.html
7)example.html:This page basically contains a link tag with bootstrap link and style tag contains .class where .classname helps us to select the elements with specific class and body tag contains a link to navigate to grid.html file and has a heading and para<p>.
8)grid.html:This grid.html contains courses in grid format.It has a meta name that provides information about HTML docs and integrity is the element that allows to check the source file.In the style tag we have .grid and .griditem that tells us about the class grid and grid-item in body class .class will define equal styles for the elements with same name. .classname helps us to select the elements with specific class.In style we have used some specific properties to grid like grid-row,grid-column.I have used navigation bar <nav> which is a list of links.I have used ul and links.This page will navigate user to another page inheritance.html page.
9)inheritance.html:Here i have used link tag and href value to inheritance.scss  where that contains properties of 3 .class files with font size,weight,etc.., and each with different background colors to differentiate 3 classes.
